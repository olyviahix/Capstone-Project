Social Society is a social media app that is based off of your interest in life! When you create an account with us, you will be prompted to add interests to your account. Food, music, hobbies, and even an option to add your own interest! This apps purpose is to bring like minded, same interest people together! After you've created your account, you will then be brought to the feed page, like most social media pages. The difference with Social Society is there is a section on all pages that "Suggests" other users to follow, who have the same or similar interests as you! Lets get together!

The technologies that were used throughout this group project were JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, Node.js, VSCode, Trello, GitHub

Some of the challanges that we faced in this group project were adding the photo option and having it store on the backend database per user. The option to add a photo to your profile of your choice, or to add a photo to a post that you create. We have a few photos that you can add that are pre-selected for you, that you can choose for a profile picture and your cover photo.

Some favorite aspects of this group project for each of us are as follows:
<br>
# Olyvia 
liked the idea overall because it brings people together and is a great way to simply meet people with the same interests as you! The simple design and easy to navigate options are also a plus for her. 
<br>
# Amir
liked the direct messaging aspect. This gives you the option to link up with users more one on one about the interests that you share!
<br>
# Ereck 
liked working in a group setting and colaborating with each team member. He made sure we were all on the same page with checking in and updating the work progresses.

In future progress, we plan on adding the option to add your own photos for your profile and cover photo, and the option to add photos with your post.

# How To Run Social Society

If working in VSCode, open two terminals. One for the front end, and one for the backend. Npm start both of the terminals. This will start your local server and start the app in your browser.


# How To Use Social Society

Once you have started the server and the project is running, you will be brought to a "Create User" page. You can enter your information and it will be stored in the backend database. You will then be prompted to click on your interests. Those will also be saved in the database and linked to you as the user. If you already have an account, simply click "login". Once you are logged in, you will be brought to the main feed page. You will see posts from users you follow, and also can post your own status from there too. On the left you will see the navbar that has the home link, profile link, notifications link, messages link, settings link, and logout option. On the right, you will see a section that gives you options of other users to follow, that have selected the same interests as you! This is how you connect to those similar to you.
