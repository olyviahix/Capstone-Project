# Social Society

Social Media Group Project - Olyvia Hix, Amir Ali, Ereck Butler

Social Society is a social media app that is based off of your interest in life! When you create an account with us, you will be prompted to add interests to your account. Food, music, hobbies, and even an option to add your own interest! This apps purpose is to bring like minded, same interest people together! After you've created your account, you will then be brought to the feed page, like most social media pages. The difference with Social Society is there is a section on all pages that "Suggests" other users to follow, who have the same or similar interests as you! Lets get together!

# How To Run Social Society

If working in VSCode, open two terminals. One for the front end, and one for the backend. Npm start both of the terminals. This will start your local server and start the app in your browser. 

# How To Use Social Society

Once you have started the server and the project is running, you will be brought to a "Create User" page. You can enter your information and it will be stored in the backend database. You will then be prompted to click on your interests. Those will also be saved in the database and linked to you as the user. If you already have an account, simply click "login". Once you are logged in, you will be brought to the main feed page. You will see posts from users you follow, and also can post your own status from there too. On the left you will see the navbar that has the home link, profile link, notifications link, messages link, settings link, and logout option. On the right, you will see a section that gives you options of other users to follow, that have selected the same interests as you! This is how you connect to those similar to you.
